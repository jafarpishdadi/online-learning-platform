**Part 1: The Project Objective**

The consulting platform will allow subscribers to book an appointment(office hours) with them. The appointmentâ€™s communication method will be primarily in the form of a text chat UI.

**Part 2: The Key Personas**

James LeBron, 17 years old and Center City High student, wishes to aid his community through volunteering/charity work. Because of the current state of the world, volunteering in person is difficult. This makes it difficult to get qualified for different volunteering tasks. Thus, James is trying to look for an e-learning platform that can help him get started. He wishes to invest some of the money he earned through part-time jobs for e-learning platforms in order to gain more knowledge and experience. 

Rafael Smith, 31 years old, founder of the Lucky Clover Charity. Due to not having any experience in organizing a charity, Rafael needed somewhere where he can learn about the organizational process. But due to the state of the world, Rafael had difficulty in finding teachers using traditional learning platforms and thus he turned to e-learning. However, he does not know which platform to use. His main requirements are that it is simple to use, has a large community, and has a large list of people to seek help from.

Sarah Brown, 24, is a Learner for U Impactify, and a teacher for a secondary school in Ontario. As more educational falculties begin delivering material online instead of in person, Sarah realized that she does not have enough experience in online education to provide the same level of education as she would in person. She turns to U impactify hoping that she can learn how to better use e-learning to teach others. She hopes that the service will be easy to use and understand.

**Part 3: The Key Scenarios**

Roswald finds that the virtual course is not as interactive as in-person courses and would like a more hands-on alternative. Because of the current state of the world, in-person courses are not possible and so Roswald is left with the problem of only having virtual courses as an alternative.

Bilbo is having trouble with the pacing of his course and would like for the content to be more spread out throughout its duration. He wants to communicate this to his impact consultant but is worried of slowing down the content for everyone taking the same course.

Jason is taking a course on U Impactify and often there are some topics he needs further clarification on to improve his understanding. He would like to have a channel of communication where he can reach the impact consultant for short questions. Moreover, he would like to be able to schedule a meeting with his consultant to discuss topics in more detail.

**Part 4: The Key Principles**

Ease of use for the user - do not incorporate any complicated elements in the application

Community - user should have a sense of community when using the platform and feel at ease

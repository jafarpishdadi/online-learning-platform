**Reflect on how your team worked together.**



*   Overall our team worked very well together. We were able to listen to each other's feedback and work collaboratively in an efficient manner. 

**How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?**



*    We made use of google docs as well as discord to organize our team - we spoke with each other to ensure that everyone was fine with the decisions being made.

**How did you make decisions?**



*   Discussed possible ideas before we committed to an idea.

**How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?**



*   To determine priority or points of user stories we spoke about the use story in detail to determine what work it required from our team and then from there we assigned it an adequate point/priority. For the most part everyone had a similar understanding so we were able to come to a consensus of ideas we brainstormed rather efficiently.

**Did you meet in person or online?**



*   We met online due to the imminent fear of catching a case of COVID-19.

**How frequently did you meet?**



*   We met twice during the week and messaged each other throughout the week.

**What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?**



*   A major lesson was that we should plan ahead next time to avoid going back and changing things that had been already marked as complete as this hindered our ability to progress to the next step

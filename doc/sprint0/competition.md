**Linkedin Learning**

Our product is similar to this in the sense that both offer expert-led courses, personalized and adaptive learning as well as easy access to all relevant courses in one place. Our product offers automated matching with opportunities and trends as well as AI-powered consultant insights. Our product is also better for nonprofits to offer their service and provide those less fortunate with opportunities to learn online. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Udemy</span>**

**[https://www.udemy.com/](https://www.udemy.com/)**

Udemy is an open online course provider that is aimed at professional adults and students. Our product differs in the sense that it gives an opportunity for those in the social purpose sector to connect with students. Nonprofits are also able to offer their services on our platform which is something not seen on udemy. 

**Blackboard Collaborate**

Our product is different in the sense that not only does it offer a platform to learn but also a platform to gain employment, volunteer and consulting support. It is a great place for users to get connected with great teachers as well as employers. Our product is great for offering e-learning, e-facilitation and e-coaching. Our product is also different in the sense that it gives the social purpose sector an opportunity to connect with various different users in a way that's much easier than the traditional and costly search and matching process between impact learners, consultants and the social purpose organizations. 

**Zoom**

**[https://zoom.us/](https://zoom.us/)**

Our product offers a much better learning and teaching experience in comparison to this platform as ours is more interactive. Our platform is also more user friendly and simpler to use and feels more like a classroom instead of a meeting room. It is much easier for students to use only one platform for assignments, notes, announcements,etc., which is something Zoom doesn’t offer as usually it is just a link found on an offsite. Our product would be better suited for students of all ages as well as people in the social purpose sector. The original design of the competitors product was not focused on e-learning. 

**Microsoft Teams**

**[https://teams.microsoft.com/](https://teams.microsoft.com/)**

Our product offers a simpler learning and teaching experience for those who aren’t very comfortable with technology. It offers a less confusing way to access files available to the users. Our product provides a much more user friendly interface which will be easier for younger students to access. It also does not offer a way for those in the social purpose sector to connect with students and educators. 

**Google Classroom**

**[https://classroom.google.com/](https://classroom.google.com/)**

Our product offers more personalized and adaptive learning in comparison to our competitor, Google Classroom. It is much easier to access all the relevant courses in one place. We are also stronger in the sense that we match many students with opportunities and trends that will serve as great benefit to them in the short term and long term. Stronger calendar function allows for easier integration and efficiency in planning.

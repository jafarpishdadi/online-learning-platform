**Team-capacity:** 50 points

**Meeting Participants**: Kirusan, Andy, Prashanth, Christopher, Jeremy, Lingfeng, Osman 

**Decisions regarding user stories:**  Tasks that can be completed by one person will be completed by one person. Tasks that require a back-end and front-end will be worked on by two people (one coming from the back-end team and one coming from the front-end team). The table below displays who worked on which tasks during this sprint.

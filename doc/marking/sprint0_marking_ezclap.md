## Notes:
- Summary
    - Very good principles!
    - Key Users are not explicitely identified. Personas are present and I can see the users _in_ the personas but this section was looking to highlight the different types of users(e.g from [slide](https://cmsweb.utsc.utoronto.ca/cscc01f20/project/U-Impactify.pdf#page=3) Social Initiative, Impact Consultant, Impact Learner)
    - In depth explanation found in article from [handout](https://articles.uie.com/short_form_creative_brief/)
- Product Backlog
  - Persona missing to indicate feature for specific users
  - Writing is concise but:
    - No acceptance crtieria
    - User story format not followed (As a \<type of user\>, I want to \<functionality\> so that \<benefit\>)
    - Template link: [User_Story_Template](https://cmsweb.utsc.utoronto.ca/cscc01f20/lectures/user-story-template.png)
- User experience
  - Missing color theme. Details such as images are missing. Text shouldn't be replaced with text. More details for mockups are always better for a more swift implementation
